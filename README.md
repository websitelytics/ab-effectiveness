### Effectiveness of A/B experimentation platform

A small peace of my research for the methodology of A/B testing platform evaluation. This research was done for a big retail company that operates both in online and offline. The total research includes the following topics:

- Can we evaluate the effectiveness with "meta holdout" approach (global control) .
- What data we should collect to evaluate the effectiveness with the "experiment id level" approach.
- What statistical tests we should use for that purpose.
- Examples of the tests with the synthetic data simulations.
- Mathematical formulations behind "Bucketization" (subsampling without overlapping) statistical calculations.
- etc.
