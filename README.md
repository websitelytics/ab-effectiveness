### Effectiveness of A/B experimentation platform

A small peace of my research for the methodology of A/B testing platform evaluation. This research was done for a big retail company that operate both in offline and online modes. The total research includes the following topics:

- Can we evaluate the effectiveness with "meta holdout" approach (global control) 
- What data we should collect to evaluate the effectiveness with the "experiment id level" approach
- What statistical tests we should use for that purpose
- Examples on the synthetic data simulations
- Mathematical formulations behind "Bucketization" (subsampling without overlapping) approach
- etc.
